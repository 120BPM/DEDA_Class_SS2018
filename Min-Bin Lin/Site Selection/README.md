# Using Folium Package for Site Location Selection  #
## A Case for New-entry Retailers to the Xinyi District of Taipei ##
----------
### Introduction ###
Taiwan had the second highest in the world for the ratio of convenience stores per population in 2017. 7-Eleven has 5,221 locations in Taiwan, with 767 listed just in the city of Taipei. FamilyMart has more than 3000 outlets across the country, and HiLife and OKMart are also found through out Taiwan. The retailer market is extremely competitive. As a result, it is considerably difficult for a new-entry retailer to start the business and overcome the barriers built by existing retailers. In this project, we consider the store distribution of four main convenience stores: 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, HiLife and OKmart, distribution of population and MRT exits to build a thematic map as a reference for new-entry retailers to select new store location.
